```{r setup3, include=FALSE}
library("knitr")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
# Set root directory from Rmd dir to project dir
opts_knit$set(root.dir = "..")
```

```{r data3, include=FALSE}
# Load data --------------------
adm <- readRDS("Data/import_adm.rds")
dis <- readRDS("Data/import_dis.rds")
```

We applied several preliminary cleaning steps to the raw imported data.

* Number of rows in raw admission data frame = `r nrow(adm)`
* Number of rows in raw outcome data frame = `r nrow(dis)`

## Removing duplicate entries

We defined exact duplicates as entries where values for all variables were
identical to one or more other entries. This occurs when data are exported from
a study tablet before previous data have been erased, resulting in some entries
being exported in duplicate.

Number of duplicate entries:

```{r prelim1, cache=TRUE}
tibble(
  form = c("admission", "outcome"),
  duplicates = c(
    sum(duplicated(adm[, 2:ncol(adm)])),
    sum(duplicated(dis[, 2:ncol(dis)]))
  )
)

adm <- adm %>% filter(!duplicated(.[, 2:ncol(.)]))
dis <- dis %>% filter(!duplicated(.[, 2:ncol(.)]))
```

## Recoding missing values

We recoded empty cells or cells containing strings that signify missingness as
missing values using the following custom function:

```{r prelim2}
recodeMissing

adm <- adm %>% mutate(across(everything(), recodeMissing))
dis <- dis %>% mutate(across(everything(), recodeMissing))
```

## Standardising variables between admission & outcome forms

We standardised `mode of delivery` and `sex` between admission and outcome forms,
so they can be used for record linkage.

Labels before standardisation:

```{r prelim3}
list(
  "Mode of delivery (admission)" = levels(factor(adm$Admission.ModeDelivery)),
  "Mode of delivery (outcome)" = levels(factor(dis$Discharge.Delivery)),
  "Sex (admission)" = levels(factor(adm$Admission.Gender)),
  "Sex (outcome)" = levels(factor(dis$Discharge.SexDis))
)
```

Labels after standardisation:

```{r prelim4}
adm <- adm %>%
  mutate(
    Admission.ModeDelivery = recode(
      Admission.ModeDelivery,
      "1" = "SVD",
      "2" = "Vent",
      "3" = "For",
      "4" = "ElCS",
      "5" = "ECS",
      "6" = "SVD"
    ),
    Admission.Gender = recode(Admission.Gender, "NS" = "U")
  )

list(
  "Mode of delivery (admission)" = levels(factor(adm$Admission.ModeDelivery)),
  "Mode of delivery (outcome)" = levels(factor(dis$Discharge.Delivery)),
  "Sex (admission)" = levels(factor(adm$Admission.Gender)),
  "Sex (outcome)" = levels(factor(dis$Discharge.SexDis))
)
```

## Removing entries without a healthcare worker identifier

We removed entries that had not been ‘signed off’ by a healthcare worker with
their healthcare worker identifier (HCW ID) (commonly their initials). Entries
without a HCW ID occur for several reasons, e.g. (1) a healthcare worker
accidentally exits the app and starts a new form upon reopening it; (2) a
healthcare worker is demonstrating how to use the app to another user so does
not want to mark the form as a genuine entry.

Number of entries without a HCW ID:

```{r prelim5}
tibble(
  form = c("admission", "outcome"),
  "no HCW ID" = c(
    sum(is.na(adm$Admission.HCWID)),
    sum(is.na(dis$Discharge.HCWIDDis))
  )
)

adm <- adm %>% filter(!is.na(.$Admission.HCWID))
dis <- dis %>% filter(!is.na(.$Discharge.HCWIDDis))
```

## Removing outcome form entries with invalid unique identifiers

Invalid UIDs were:

```{r prelim6}
adm <- adm %>%
  mutate(
    Admission.UID_alphanum =
      gsub("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "", adm$Admission.UID)
  )

dis <- dis %>%
  mutate(
    Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum =
      gsub("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "", dis$Discharge.NeoTreeID)
  )

tibble(
  format = c(
    "missing values",
    "strings of only zeros",
    "strings shorter than 4 characters long",
    "strings containing words"
    ),
  freq = c(
    sum(is.na(dis$Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum)),
    sum(grepl("^(0)\\1{0,}$", dis$Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum)),
    sum(nchar(dis$Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum) < 4, na.rm = TRUE),
    sum(
      grepl("twin", dis$Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum) | 
        grepl("and", dis$Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum)
      )
    )
)

dis <- dis %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(.$Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum),
    !grepl("^(0)\\1{0,}$", .$Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum),
    # "^(0)\\1{0,}$" finds strings of just zeros
    !nchar(.$Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum) < 4,
    !grepl("twin", .$Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum),
    !grepl("and", .$Discharge.NeoTreeID_alphanum)
  )
```

## Limiting entries to the study period 

We removed entries outwith the study period. This included entries prior to
01/02/2019, which constituted the 'pilot period' of data collection for the
Neotree at SMCH.

```{r prelim7, include=FALSE}
adm <- adm %>%
  filter(
    ymd_hms(
      Admission.DateTimeAdmission,
      tz = "Africa/Harare"
    ) >= "2019-02-01"
  )

dis <- dis %>%
  filter(
    ymd_hms(
      Discharge.DateTimeDischarge,
      tz = "Africa/Harare"
    ) >= "2019-02-01" |
      ymd_hms(
        Discharge.DateTimeDeath,
        tz = "Africa/Harare"
      ) >= "2019-02-01"
  )
```

Data import and preliminary cleaning resulted in one data frame for admission
forms and one data frame for outcome forms.

* Number of rows in final admission data frame = `r nrow(adm)`
* Number of rows in final outcome data frame = `r nrow(dis)`
